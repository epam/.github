# Welcome

EPAM supports and is committed to the free software philosophy and views the open source approach as a powerful development methodology, inviting collaboration with like-minded developers around the world.

We have a proud history of contributing to open source software and invite you to explore some of our well-established, free and open source projects available to the public under a variety of OSI licenses.

# Get started

Interested in engaging with measuring organizational commits?
